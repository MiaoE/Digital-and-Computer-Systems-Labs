# ESC253-Digital-and-Computer-Systems-Labs
This repo contains nine labs related to programming digital systems and chips. The first six labs use SystemVerilog low-level language to program the FPGA circuit board using Intel Quartus Prime, a logic device design software. The last three labs are for practicing assembly using RISC-V assembly language.

[ESC253](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ece253h1) is a course that teaches students about digital system design principles. Topics include: logic circuits, arithmetics, registers, flip-flops, finite state machines, memory hierarchy, polling and interrupts.
