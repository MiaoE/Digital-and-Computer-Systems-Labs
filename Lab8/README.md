# Lab 8: Lists and Subroutines
In part 1, the code from Lab 7 part 2 is modified to search for the longest string of 1s
from a list of words using subroutines.

In part 2, the program should use bubble sort to sort a list of 32-bit unsigned numbers 
in ascending order. The first number in the list would indicate how many numbers there
are in the list. The `.word` directive would look like below:
```
LIST
.word 10, 1400, 45, 23, 5, 3, 8, 17, 4, 20, 33
```
The first number in the list is `10`, meaning that there are 10 words in the list.
